                        <h6>A chrome extension is a program that is installed in the Chrome browser that enhances the functionality of the browser. You can build one easily using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</h6>
                        <h6>Creating a chrome extension is similar to creating a web application, but it requires a manifest.json file which we will discuss below section of this post.</h6>

                        <p class="h5 text-primary mt-5">Manifest.json File : </p>
                        <p>As we discussed earlier, building a Chrome extension is similar to building any web application. The only difference is that the Chrome extension requires a manifest.json file where we keep all the configurations.</p>
                        <p>The manifest.json file contains all the necessary information required to build the Chrome extension. It is the first file the extension checks and everything is loaded from this single file.</p>
                        <p>Now, let's create a manifest.json file in the root folder and add the following</p>
                        <p>Our manifest.json file contains the value of name, version, description, manifest_version (3 in this case, which is the latest manifest version), author, and action fields. In the action field, there's the value for default_popup which contains the path to the HTML file which is index.html in this example.</p>                        
                        <p>You can have a look <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/manifest/" target="_blank">here</a> to see all configurations of a manifest.json file.</p>
